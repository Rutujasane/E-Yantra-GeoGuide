# Autonomous Bot Navigation

This project is an autonomous robot that navigates a custom arena using real-time computer vision and a machine learning model. The system identifies various "events" on the arena floor, plans a priority-based route, and guides the robot to each location.

## How It Works

The project operates through a complete perception-to-action pipeline:

1.  **See & Understand:** An overhead camera captures the arena. OpenCV processes the video feed, corrects the perspective, and tracks the robot's position using ArUco markers.

2.  **Classify Events:** A pre-trained PyTorch (InceptionV3) model analyzes the camera feed to identify and classify 5 different types of events on the arena floor.

3.  **Plan the Route:** Based on the importance of the identified events, a path-planning algorithm dynamically creates the most efficient route for the robot to follow.

4.  **Execute the Mission:** The main Python script sends movement commands over WiFi to the ESP32-powered robot, which navigates the arena grid to complete its objectives.

## Key Features
